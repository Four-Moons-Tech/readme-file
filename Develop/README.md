## Description
     
* This app generates a high-quality, professional README.md file with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. This is a command-line application that accepts user input.  A user is asked a series of questions such as description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. User’s answers are added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. When user chooses a license for my application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. When user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile. When a user enters their email address then it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions. When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, the links take the user to the corresponding section of the README.  
* _What motivates me to do this project?_ We, developers, are very busy. I prefer to spend time solving problems and coming up with ideas and automating routine tasks like preparing a readme file.
* _Why did I build this application?_ Following a business process flow makes it easier to create an important file that would otherwise take a few hours. 
* _What did I learn?_ I learned what a professional readme file should contain and how important it is to include that information. I learned about badges and how to display them. I learned how to generate a document using a command line.  
* _What problem does my application solve?_ My app ensures that the user does not miss important information.
